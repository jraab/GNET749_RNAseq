# Class 2 practice

# Using nycflights 13 package
# Do the calculations and think if there is an effective plot to show your result

# What airport had the highest average wind


#Wait - what? who had 1000+ mile an hour windspeed

# Maybe we should exclude that value since it seems like an error

# Which month had the highest average wind



# Did you get an error about 'group' x needs to be a factor to plot this the way you want

# Which airport and month had the most rain

# are rainy days windier?


# USing the rnaseq in data/drug_norm_counts.csv and drug_samples.csv try the following
# load data


#Plot GAPDH expression in treatment (DMSO vs EPZ)
# First pivot the wide data

# Then combine with sample info (samples key)


# Now you can plot a gene of interest
